# Fix My Code Challenge

Fix my code is a new type of project, where we'll jump into an existing code base and fix it! This is done using pre-written repos as initial files for all solutions. I'm not coding anything new, just fixing the existing code base.

This was a project provided by ALX in which I was challenged with debugging various programs. The challenges spanned a variety of programming languages from C to Python to Javascript to Ruby and more, some of which I was familiar with, others of which I was not. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. Fix my code](./0x00-challenge)

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
